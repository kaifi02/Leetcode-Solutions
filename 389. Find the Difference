You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 1000
t.length == s.length + 1
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.


Solution :


Code in C:

char findTheDifference(char * s, char * t){
    int sum1=0;
    int sum2=0;
    int i=0,diff=0;
    char ans;
    while(s[i]!='\0')
    {
        sum1=sum1+ s[i];
        i++;
    }
    i=0;
    while(t[i]!='\0')
    {
        sum2=sum2+ t[i];
        i++;
    }
    diff=sum2-sum1;
    ans=diff;
    return ans;
}
