The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows: 

T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0.

Given n, return the value of Tn.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
T_3 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
T_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
Example 2:

Input: n = 25
Output: 1389537
 

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 37
The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit integer, ie. answer <= 2^31 - 1.


Solution:

Code with C:

int tribonacci(int n){
int sum=0,i,tn,tn1,tn2,ans=1;
if(n==0)return 0;
tn=0;
tn1=1;
tn2=1;
for(i=3;i<=n;i++)
{
  sum=tn + tn1 + tn2;
  tn=tn1;
  tn1=tn2;
  tn2=sum;
  ans=sum;
}
return ans;
}
