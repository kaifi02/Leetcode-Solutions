An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1690


Solution:

Code in C:


bool isUgly(int n){
     if(n<1)return false;
      while(n%2==0)n=n/2;
      while(n%3==0)n=n/3;
      while(n%5==0)n=n/5;
      return n==1;
}
int nthUglyNumber(int n){
    int i=2,count=1;
    while(count!=n)
    {
        if(isUgly(i))
        {
          count++;
          i++;
        }
        else
        {
          i++;
        }
    }
    return i-1;
}
